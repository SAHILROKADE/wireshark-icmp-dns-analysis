# Wireshark ICMP and DNS Capture Analysis

This repository contains a Wireshark capture file (`ping_google.pcap`) which records ICMP (ping) and DNS traffic generated by pinging google.com. The capture was performed on Kali Linux and demonstrates basic network traffic and protocol filtering using Wireshark.

## What was done:
- Captured live network packets for about 60 seconds using Wireshark.
- Generated traffic by pinging google.com.
- Filtered the captured packets by protocols such as ICMP, DNS, and TCP.
- Identified at least three different protocols in the capture.
- Saved and exported the capture as a `.pcap` file.
- Uploaded the capture and this README for reference and further analysis.

## How to open the capture file:
- Open `ping_google.pcap` using Wireshark or any other compatible packet analysis tool.

## Summary:
This capture helps understand network traffic, protocol communication, and packet analysis fundamentals using Wireshark.
